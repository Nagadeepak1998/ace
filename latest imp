Hi Aptin,
Just wanted to confirm that I was able to identify the source of the black bar under the table headings. It’s controlled through the Column Headings → Border section in the Default table style under Trees and Tables. Once we check the “Use default border” option for that format, the black bar gets removed as expected. Let me know if you'd like to review or explore other styling tweaks.

Thanks!
