Hi Aptin,

I traced the yellow outline this afternoon.

* It’s coming from the **Action area → Box** format in the **SCE Enterprise** skin.  
* Someone previously over‑rode the border colour to the yellow you’re seeing.  
* We can change that colour (or remove the border entirely) at this single spot and it will update every screen that uses the Action‑area container.

Let me know the colour / thickness you’d like and I’ll update the skin and push it with the next cache refresh.

Thanks!  
Naga
