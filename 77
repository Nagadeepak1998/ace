Thanks, Abtin! I’ve opened the file and will start reviewing it right away. I’ll go through the manual carefully and apply some clean UI/UX suggestions based on our previous discussions. I’ll share a marked-up version or a redesigned draft soon. Appreciate the opportunity!

Hi Robert,

Thanks for pointing that out.

I'm not entirely sure why the Pay Period End Date on the 2nd row isn’t auto-updating as expected—I entered the correct start date, so it should have picked it up. In any case, I’ve reviewed and corrected it manually.

Please find attached the updated timesheet once again.

Thanks for your patience, and have a great day!

Best regards,
Nagadeepak Appalaneni
