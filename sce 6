Here’s a left‑to‑right “walk‑through” of what each block in the drawing is doing and how everything ties together.  (You don’t have to read it in order—each numbered heading stands on its own.)

## 1. PV source: 15 roof‑mounted modules with micro‑inverters
| Branch | Qty. of IQ8‑PLUS micro‑inverters | Nominal AC current¹ |
|--------|----------------------------------|---------------------|
| #1     | 8                                | 8 × 1.35 A = 10.8 A |
| #2     | 7                                | 7 × 1.35 A = 9.45 A |

* **Module spec (top title block):** 15 × 410 W = 6.15 kW DC  
* Each IQ8‑PLUS converts the panel’s DC to **240 V, 1‑phase AC** right on the roof, so only AC leaves the array.
* Trunk cables run between inverters; the “termination cap” shown on the last inverter seals the cable.

¹The IQ8‑PLUS datasheet lists 1.35 A max continuous current.

---

## 2. Home‑run wiring to the roof junction box
* Both branch circuits drop into a **roof J‑box** (labeled “(N) JUNCTION BOX”) where the two trunk cables land on lugs.
* From that J‑box a single **¾‑inch EMT** conduit (see “wire tag A” in the table at the bottom) routes the combined output to the next enclosure.

---

## 3. IQ Combiner 4 box
This enclosure does three jobs:

| Inside the Combiner | Purpose |
|---------------------|---------|
| **PV 20 A breaker** | Over‑current protection for the combined PV output. |
| **IQ Gateway**      | Communications brain: reads the CTs and sends data to Enphase cloud. |
| **Production CT**   | Measures how much solar is exported. |

The combiner output leaves on **wire tag C** (10 AWG, ¾″ EMT) and heads to the outdoor AC disconnect.

---

## 4. Lockable 60 A AC disconnect (B)
Required by most AHJs/utility companies. It’s manual, **non‑fused, visible‑open** and can be locked open for service.

---

## 5. Battery subsystem (Enphase Encharge 10)
* Three “Encharge 3.3” units are drawn (you can see the three rectangles). Together they form a **10 kWh AC‑coupled battery**.
* Each unit lands on its own **20 A breaker** inside the combiner (shown just left of the battery icons).
* A “Battery CT” (dashed purple line) tells the Gateway how fast the battery is charging/discharging so it can enforce grid‑export limits.
* A small **“Battery disconnect” switch** is called out below the units for emergency isolation.

> **No backup power:**  
> The note under the array explicitly says *“There is no Microgrid Interconnection Device (MID)… battery does **not** provide backup or operate when the grid is down.”*  
> In other words, this is **grid‑tied only**—if utility power goes away, so does the PV & battery.

---

## 6. Main service panel (E)
* Existing **200 A bus** with a **150 A main breaker** (they’re “derating” the original 200 A main to 150 A per the note at the bottom so the 120 % rule works).
* Feeders coming in from:
  * **40 A breaker** – PV back‑feed
  * **100 A breaker** – Battery back‑feed
* The math in the call‑out box at upper‑right shows:  
  `150 A (main) + 40 A (PV) + 22.6 A + 13.2 A ≈ 226 A`, which is under the 240 A (200 A bus × 120 %) limit.

---

## 7. Utility meter & service conductors
* A **bi‑directional 1‑Ø 120/240 V meter** records both import and export.
* Service feed is underground.  
* “Primary consumption CTs” on the service conductors give whole‑home usage to the Gateway.

## 8. Conduit / wire schedule (bottom table)
| Tag | Conduit | CU Wires | Gauge | Temp rating | Ampacity calc | What it feeds |
|-----|---------|----------|-------|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| A   | ¾″ EMT  | 4 + G    | 10 AWG THHN‑2 | 90 °C | 29.12 A | J‑box → Combiner |
| B   | ¾″ EMT  | 3 + G    | 6 AWG THHN‑2  | 90 °C | 55.0 A | Combiner → AC disconnect |
| C   | 1″ PVC  | 2 + G    | 8 AWG THWN‑2  | 75 °C | 40.0 A | Battery circuit |
*(Only the first rows are shown here—the table continues for all circuits.)*

## 9. How power flows under normal operation
```text
Sunlight → PV module → IQ8 micro‑inverter (AC) 
         → Branch circuit → Roof J‑box → IQ Combiner (20 A breaker)
         → 60 A AC disconnect → 40 A breaker in Main Panel
         → House loads first; surplus exported through meter.

If battery has room to charge:
Main Panel → 100 A Battery breaker → Encharge 10 (AC‑coupled)
           → Battery CT tracks charge/discharge.
```
